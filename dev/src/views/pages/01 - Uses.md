# First Post

New website! Hooray! Start off with credits. These are what made this website possible:

## Tools

Creating a website from scratch and getting it on the internet is hard. Luckily, there are plenty of great open-source tools out there that made things much easier for me:

- The __hosting__ is provided for free by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which automatically deploys the __source code__ stored in [my Github repo](https://github.com/CalebBurton/calebburton.com).
- The __visual design__ was customized from a template on [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/), which was provided for free under the [CC BY 3.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).
- The files are stitched together and __compiled__ using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/): a free, open-source static site generator licensed under the [Apache license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
- I __edit__ the code with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): a free, open-source text editor maintained by Microsoft and distributed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
- The majority of the __photos__ come from [Upsplash](https://unsplash.com/), which are provided for free under the [Upsplash license](https://unsplash.com/license). Credits for the specific artists are provided on the relevant photos themselves rather than here in this list.
- __Icons__ come from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/), which both provide their assets for free under the Creative Commons BY license. FontAwesome uses [version 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), while the Noun Project uses [version 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).
  - The pirate favicon was designed by [AlfredoCreates](https://thenounproject.com/AlfredoCreates/).
- __Quality assurance__ was performed with [Katalon Studio](https://www.katalon.com/), an automated testing suite provided for free under the [Katalon License](https://www.katalon.com/license-agreement/).
- As far as __pre-processors__ go, I rely on [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to handle my CSS, [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to clean up my javascript, and [Alex](http://alexjs.com/) to proofread my posts. All three are free, open-source, and provided under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
- This initial version uses [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) as its __javascript framework__, which is provided under a [custom license](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/LICENSE.txt). I plan to migrate away from it in the future, but for now it's still an important part of the site.
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) pulled everything together and acted as the __platform__ for implementing many of the tools described above. It is an open-source project provided for free under a [custom license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodejs/node/master/LICENSE).

## Tidbits

I used snippets of code from various blogs and designers to spice things up and add small features to the site:

- The header image's parallax scroll effect comes from [Karl Danninger](https://www.okgrow.com/posts/css-only-parallax) at OK Grow

## Reference

Between HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the surrounding frameworks, there's a lot to remember when creating a website. These resources were invaluable for learning syntax, remembering functionalities, and seeing example code:

- CSS design mostly came from [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
- For HTML and JavaScript, I referenced the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- Whenever I needed specific examples, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) was there for me
