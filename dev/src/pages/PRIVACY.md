# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Caleb Burton ("I", "me", or "my") operates a number of API clients and websites, which provide various SERVICES. This text informs you of policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use these Services. If you choose to use my Services, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation with this policy. A summary of the contents is as follows: __the Services may collect personal data, such as your IP address. This data will not be shared with _any_ third parties and will not be used for _any_ purpose aside from allowing you to utilize the Services.__

The language used throughout may feel unnecessarily formal or detailed, this is because it was developed using the [GDPR Generator](https://privacypolicytemplate.net/) and only slightly modified to suit my purposes. In reality, a personal site such as this probably doesn't need a privacy policy. I include one mainly for the experience of creating and maintaining it, rather than out of a sense of legal obligation.

## Information Collection and Use

### Log Data

I want to inform you that whenever you visit my Services, I collect information that your browser sends to me called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser version, pages of my Services that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, and other statistics.

### Cookies

Cookies are files with small amount of data that is commonly used an anonymous unique identifier. These are sent to your browser from the website that you visit and are stored on your computer’s hard drive.

Some of my Services use these cookies to collect information and improve my Services. You have the right to either accept or refuse these cookies, and know when a cookie is being sent to your computer. If you choose to refuse my cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of my Services.

### Links to Other Sites

My Services may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I advise you to review the Privacy Policy of said websites. I have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

### Children’s Privacy

My Services do not address, and I do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from, anyone under the age of 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I will immediately delete this from my servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to complete the necessary actions.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, I advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this page. This privacy policy was created with the GDPR Generator.
